  <h1>Happy Places </h1>

  <p>As we learn that tress can cause physical and psychological damage if one
    doesn’t learn how to manage it effectively. One of the easiest ways to reduce
    stress and experience an instant happiness boost is to visit your happy place
    on a regular basis. Regardless of what’s going on in one’s external environment,
    a few minutes in a happy place can help people revitalize their brain and their
    body so that they can manage stressful situations more effectively.
  </p>
<h4>What are happy places?</h4>
<p>
When people do not have a good day, or when things seem to not go the way they
expect them to, people tend to want to escape the world and go to the place
they can find joy and comfort; a so-called “happy place”. It does not have to
be luxurious, such as at a beach in Bora Bora or Maldives. It could be anywhere:
 in one's backyard, somewhere on the green rice field where one can smell the
 grass and let the wind kiss their face. It doesn’t matter where it is, as long
 as one feels happy to think about and relax with it in mind. It might take time
  to build it in one's imagination.
</p>
<h4>Do these 7 steps before you start drawing</h4>
<ul class="a">
  <li>Find a physical place that is relax for you and make yourself comfortable</li>
  <li>Close your eyes and identify where your happy place is</li>
  <li>It can be anywhere, whether you’ve been there before or not.
    Examples of great happy places include the beach, forest, favorite eatery,
    a favorite childhood place, or any other place that brings you joy.</li>
  <li>Relax your body and start the relaxation process by closing your eyes and
     tensing your toes on one foot. Hold the tension for five seconds and then
     relax the muscles for thirty seconds. You should feel the muscles in your
     toes begin to relax.</li>
  <li>Repeat this process with the toes on your other foot and then move up to
    your calves. Continue to tense your muscles for five seconds and then relax
    them for 30 seconds as you progressively work your way up your body</li>
  <li>Immersing yourself through visualization</li>
  <li>Begin visualizing by mentally seeing yourself in your happy place</li>
  <li>Now then click and drag on the screen to draw how your happy place look
    like. You can choose to draw a particular element in that happy place. </li>
